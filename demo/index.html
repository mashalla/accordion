                            The first suggestion that all organisms may have had a common
                            ancestor and diverged through random variation and natural selection was
                            made in 1745 by the French mathematician and scientist Pierre-Louis
                            Moreau de Maupertuis (1698-1759) in his work Venus physique.

                        <blockquote>
                            "Could one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the
                            productions of nature, as there must be some characterized by a certain
                            relation of fitness which are able to subsist, it is not to be wondered
                            at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in
                            existence? Chance, one would say, produced an innumerable multitude of
                            individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a
                            manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in
                            another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order:
                            all of these latter have perished. Animals lacking a mouth could not
                            live; others lacking reproductive organs could not perpetuate
                            themselves... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what
                            blind destiny has produced..."

                            All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental
                            biochemical organization: genetic information encoded in DNA,
                            transcribed into RNA, through the effect of protein- and RNA-enzymes,
                            then translated into proteins by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP,
                            NADH and others as energy currencies, etc. Furthermore, the genetic code
                            (the "translation table" according to which DNA information is
                            translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms,
                            from bacteria to humans, with minor local differences. The universality
                            of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence
                            in favor of the theory of universal common descent. Analysis of the
                            small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for
                            universal common descent.

                        <p>
                            Artificial selection offers remarkable examples of the amount of
                            diversity that can exist between individuals sharing a late common
                            ancestor. To perform artificial selection, one begins with a particular
                            species (following examples include wolves and wild cabbage) and then,
                            at every generation, only allow certain individuals to reproduce, based
                            on the degree to which they exhibit certain desirable characteristics.
                            In time, it is expected that these characteristics become increasingly
                            well-developed in successive generations. Many examples of artificial
                            selection, like the ones below, occurred without the guidance of modern
                            scientific insight.
