					<h4>Common ancestor</h4>
					<p>
						The first suggestion that all organisms may have had a common
						ancestor and diverged through random variation and natural selection was
						made in 1745 by the French mathematician and scientist Pierre-Louis
						Moreau de Maupertuis (1698-1759) in his work Venus physique.
						Specifically:

					<h4>Common biochemistry and genetic code</h4>
					<p>
						All known forms of life are based on the same fundamental
						biochemical organization: genetic information encoded in DNA,
						transcribed into RNA, through the effect of protein- and RNA-enzymes,
						then translated into proteins by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP,
						NADH and others as energy currencies, etc.

					<h4>Artificial selection</h4>
					<p>
						Artificial selection offers remarkable examples of the amount of
						diversity that can exist between individuals sharing a late common
						ancestor. To perform artificial selection, one begins with a particular
						species (following examples include wolves and wild cabbage) and then,
						at every generation, only allow certain individuals to reproduce, based
						on the degree to which they exhibit certain desirable characteristics.
